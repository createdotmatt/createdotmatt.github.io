title: What is the WDK?

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>


The Web Designers' Development Kit (or WDK), is a framework that allows designers to create custom templates for use within the Create system.

It enables the use of the Create colour schemes, so the design can not only have dynamic content, but dynamic colours and styles.

Spend just minutes editing a pre-made design and making it compatible with Create to create your completely customized, and controllable website.
