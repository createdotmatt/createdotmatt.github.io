To install a template, go to the "WDK" button which is found on the "Design" screen, click "New Custom Template", give the template a name and click "Add Custom Template". 

Now go to the "Upload" box, and upload all of t he files relating to that template. You can upload either all the files individually or as a collection inside of a zip file. 

All the files you upload will now be displayed in the files box where you can delete them if you need to.

N.B. You cannot delete index.html or thumb.jpg, however you can overwrite them by uploading new versions.

Once the files have been uploaded and index.html has been successfuly processed, you will be able to choose your template on the "Design" screen under "Custom" on the "Templates" tab.
