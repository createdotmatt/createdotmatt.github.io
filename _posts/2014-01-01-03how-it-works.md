title: How it Works
---

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>


The WDK requires only 1 file; index.html

It works by parsing HTML comments, formatted in a certain way, to determine where you want to place particular elements on a page.
For instance, if you wanted to place the page title within a h1 tag, you would do the following;

`<h1><!--WDK:display:pagetitle--></h1>`

Automatically, our system would read this comment tag, and generate the correct code to show the relevant page title.

Although only requiring 1 file, you can include all kinds of useful files such as javascript libraries, flash, images and css files.
