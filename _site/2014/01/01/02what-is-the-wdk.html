<h1>What is the WDK?</h1>
<p>The Web Designersâ€™ Development Kit (or WDK), is a framework that allows designers to create custom templates for use within the Create system.</p>

<p>It enables the use of the Create colour schemes, so the design can not only have dynamic content, but dynamic colours and styles.</p>

<p>Spend just minutes editing a pre-made design and making it compatible with Create to create your completely customized, and controllable website.</p>
