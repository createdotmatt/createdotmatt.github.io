- Pages are organised into folders inside the 'pages' folder. These folders to not enforce the navigation layout. In order that the page appears in the correct part of the navigation pane, ensure that that 'Group:' is correctly labelled at the top of each file. Within each group they are sorted numerically.
- The pages are compiled in the 'Markup' language.

Page Titles
- The page title will appear as the title to each post and also as the link on the left-side navigation panel.


A short guide to the Markup language

 	#header1 (biggest)
 	##header2 (big)
 	###header3 (not so big)
 	etc etc

 		1. item 1
 		2. item 3
 	OR
 		- item
 		- another item
 		- another....
