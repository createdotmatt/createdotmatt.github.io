Guide to using the markdown files;

Adding / Editing Artciles
- To add or edit the articles, you will need to add or edit the .md (markdown) files in the posts folder.
- The file name must start with a date (YYYY/MM/DD), we are using the same date for each post 
- The pages are therefore ordered numerically/alphabetically by the content after the date.

Page Titles
- The page title will appear as the title to each post and also as the link on the left-side navigation panel.
- Page titles MUST NOT include and amperstand (&)

A short guide to the Markup language
 - When writing any code, place it between two ` (this is the key next to the left shift on a mac keyboard...) - `<code goes here>`
 - Headers can be created using #
 	#header1 (biggest)
 	##header2 (big)
 	###header3 (not so big)
 	etc etc
 - Lists are made just as you would in any word processor
 		1. item 1
 		2. item 3
 	OR
 		- item
 		- another item
 		- another....
